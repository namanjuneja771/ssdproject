<p style="display:flex;justify-content:center;color:black;font-size:30px;" id="div6"><b> AGILE ESTIMATION </b></p>
<p style="margin:5%;font-size:20px">Estimation simply means a technique that is used to find out the cost estimates. The cost estimate is the financial spend that is done on the efforts to develop and test software in Software Engineering. Agile and cost estimation models are some mathematical algorithms or parametric equations that are used to estimate the cost of a product or a project.
<br>
<br>
During the development of Scrum, the team shared responsibility and collectively committed to the work of each Sprint, so the estimated workload for the agile team used a collective estimation approach.
<br>
<br>
An estimate is nothing more than a well educated guess. We use all the knowledge and experience at hand to make a guess about the amount of time it is going to take. So instead of looking at every new work item separately, why not compare it to previously finished work items? It’s easier for humans to relate to similar items than to guess the actual size of things anyway.

<p style="margin-left:10%;font-size:25px"><b><u>3) Estimate Velocity – Record and Average the team speed of each Sprint:</u></b>
The team velocity is the number of story points that the Scrum team actually completes in a Sprint. The team velocity tells you how fast the team is doing. A newly estimated project or team (without referencing velocity records in the past), we can do1-2 Sprint to measure a speed as the initial speed. In the Sprint implementation process, we need to record the speed of each Sprint, for future plans.

      <p>The Delphi Technique is a method used to estimate the likelihood and outcome of future events. A group of experts exchange views, and each independently gives estimates and assumptions to a facilitator who reviews the data and issues a summary report.</p>

      <p>In Agile software development, a storyboard can help developers quickly get a sense of what work still needs to be completed. As long as the team keeps the storyboard up to date, anyone can see what work has been completed, who's working on what and what work is left to do. This not only provides the product owner with transparency, it also helps the team to visualize the sequence and interconnectedness of user stories. Storyboards can be physical or digital.</p>

    <p> <center><text style="font-size:20px;">Step 1: Choose a Facilitator</text></center>
	<br>
	<br>
	The first step is to choose your facilitator. You may wish to take on this role yourself, or find a neutral person within your organisation. It is useful to have someone that is familiar with research and data collection. 
    </p>
    <div class="text"></div>

  <div class="mySlides fade">
    <div class="numbertext">3 / 9</div>
    <p> <center><text style="font-size:20px;">Step 2: Identify Your Experts</text></center>
	<br>
	<br>
	The Delphi technique relies on a panel of experts. This panel may be your project team, including the customer, or other experts from within your organisation or industry. An expert is, "any individual with relevant knowledge and experience of a particular topic." 
    </p>
    <div class="text"></div>

  <div class="mySlides fade">
    <div class="numbertext">4 / 9</div>
    <p> <center><text style="font-size:20px;">Step 3: Define the Problem</text></center>
	<br>
	<br>
	What is the problem or issue you are seeking to understand? The experts need to know what problem they are commenting on, so ensure you provide a precise and comprehensive definition. 
    </p>
    <div class="text"></div>

  <div class="mySlides fade">
    <div class="numbertext">5 / 9</div>
    <p> <center><text style="font-size:20px;">Step 4: Round One Questions</text></center>
	<br>
	<br>
	Ask general questions to gain a broad understanding of the experts view on future events. The questions may go out in the form of a questionnaire or survey. Collate and summarise the responses, removing any irrelevant material and looking for common viewpoints. 
    </p>
    <div class="text"></div>

  <div class="mySlides fade">
    <div class="numbertext">6 / 9</div>
    <p> <center><text style="font-size:20px;">Step 5: Round Two Questions</text></center>
	<br>
	<br>
	Based on the answers to the first questions, the next questions should delve deeper into the topic to clarify specific issues. These questions may also go out in the form of a questionnaire or survey. Again, collate and summarise the results, removing any irrelevant material and look for the common ground. Remember, we are seeking to build consensus. 
    </p>
    <div class="text"></div>

  <div class="mySlides fade">
    <div class="numbertext">7 / 9</div>
    <p> <center><text style="font-size:20px;">Step 6: Round Three Questions</text></center>
	<br>
	<br>
	The final questionnaire aims to focus on supporting decision making. Hone in on the areas of agreement. What is it the experts are all agreed upon?
<br>
<br>
You may wish to have more than three rounds of questioning to reach a closer consensus. 
    </p>

  <div class="mySlides fade">
    <div class="numbertext">8 / 9</div>
    <p> <center><text style="font-size:20px;">Step 7: Act on Your Findings</text></center>
	<br>
	<br>
	After this round of questions, your experts will have, we hope, reached a consensus and you will have a view of future events. Analyse the findings and put plans in place to deal with future risks and opportunities to your project.

    <p> <center><text style="font-size:20px;">Conclusion</text></center>
	<br>
	<br>
	Use the Delphi Technique for creating Work Breakdown Structures, identifying risks and opportunities, compiling lessons learned and anytime you would usually conduct a brainstorming session.
<br>
<br>
Predicting the future is not an exact science, but the Delphi Technique can help you understand the likelihood of future events and what impact they may have on your project.
