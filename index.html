<p style="margin:5%;font-size:20px">Estimation simply means a technique that is used to find out the cost estimates. The cost estimate is the financial spend that is done on the efforts to develop and test software in Software Engineering. Agile and cost estimation models are some mathematical algorithms or parametric equations that are used to estimate the cost of a product or a project.
</p>
<p style="margin-left:5%;font-size:30px">
<b>Agile estimation has the following three characteristics:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p style="margin-left:10%;font-size:25px"><b><u>1) Team collective estimate:</u></b>
During the development of Scrum, the team shared responsibility and collectively committed to the work of each Sprint, so the estimated workload for the agile team used a collective estimation approach.
</p>
<br>
<p style="margin-left:10%;font-size:25px"><b><u>2) Estimate size, not estimate time period, use relative estimates instead of absolute estimates:</u></b>
An estimate is nothing more than a well educated guess. We use all the knowledge and experience at hand to make a guess about the amount of time it is going to take. So instead of looking at every new work item separately, why not compare it to previously finished work items? It’s easier for humans to relate to similar items than to guess the actual size of things anyway.
</p>
<br>
<p style="margin-left:10%;font-size:25px"><b><u>3) Estimate Velocity – Record and Average the team speed of each Sprint:</u></b>
The team velocity is the number of story points that the Scrum team actually completes in a Sprint. The team velocity tells you how fast the team is doing. A newly estimated project or team (without referencing velocity records in the past), we can do1-2 Sprint to measure a speed as the initial speed. In the Sprint implementation process, we need to record the speed of each Sprint, for future plans.

      <p>The Delphi Technique is a method used to estimate the likelihood and outcome of future events. A group of experts exchange views, and each independently gives estimates and assumptions to a facilitator who reviews the data and issues a summary report.</p>

      <p>In Agile software development, a storyboard can help developers quickly get a sense of what work still needs to be completed. As long as the team keeps the storyboard up to date, anyone can see what work has been completed, who's working on what and what work is left to do. This not only provides the product owner with transparency, it also helps the team to visualize the sequence and interconnectedness of user stories. Storyboards can be physical or digital.</p>
