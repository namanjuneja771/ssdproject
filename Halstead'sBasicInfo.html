		<h3><u>1. Purpose and Origin</u></h3>
			<p>
			Halstead complexity metrics were developed by the late Maurice Halstead as a means of determining a quantitative measure of complexity directly from the operators and operands in the module to measure a program module's complexity directly from source code.
			Halstead took a linguistic approach to determine the complexity of a program. According to him, a computer program consists of a collection of different operands and operators.

    	<h3><u>2. Number of Operators and Operands</u></h3>
        HalsteadÂ´s metrics is based on interpreting the source code as a sequence of tokens and classifying each token to be an operator or an operand.
        <ul>
            <li>number of unique operators (n1)</li>
            <li>number of unique operands (n2)</li>
            <li>total number of operators (N1) </li>
            <li>total number of operands (N2)</li>
        </ul>
        Other Halstead measures are derived from these four quantities with certain fixed formulas as described below.
        <ul>
        	<li>Program length (N) = N1 + N2</li>
        	<li>Program Vocabulary (n) = n1 + n2</li>
        	<li>Program volume (V) = N*log2(n)</li>
        	<li>Diffuclty level (D) = (n1/2)*(N2/n2)</li>
        	<li>Progra level (L) = 1/D</li>
        	<li>Effort to implement (E) = V*D </li>
        	<li>Time to implement (T) = E/18 (in seconds)</li>
        	<li>Number of delivered bugs (B) = V/3000</li>
        	<li>Intelligence content (I) = V/D </li>
        </ul>
        The program volume V is the minimum number of bits needed to encode the program. It represents the size of the program while taking into account the programming language.<br>
        The difficulty metric indicates how difficult a program is to write or understand.<br>
        Effort denotes the "mental effort" required to develop the software, or to recreate the same in another programming language.<br>
